Store the values of your first name and last name in separate variables. Then add these two strings and 
store the result in a variable called full name. Create another variable whose value is the first 
name multiplied by any number of your choice. Print all four variables. Next, add one more variable 
containing any string of your choice. Find and print its length, its first and last character, and also 
print a substring of this original string.
